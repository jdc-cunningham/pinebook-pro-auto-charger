### Pinebook Pro Auto Charger

#### Disclaimer

I don't know what the implications are of pulling power from the designed source eg. 5V 3A.

So if you're interested in this, proceed at your own risk.

The setup pulls 2.58 Amps at 5V measured (at source eg. wall side) with bench top power supply when the ESP-01 shares power supply with the wall charger.
