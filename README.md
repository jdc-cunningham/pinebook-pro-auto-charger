### Pinebook Pro Auto Charger

#### Disclaimer

I don't know what the implications are of pulling power from the designed source eg. 5V 3A.

So if you're interested in this, proceed at your own risk, or use a separate power supply for the ESP-01/3V single channel relay.

The setup pulls 2.58 Amps at 5V measured with bench top power supply when the ESP-01 shares power supply with the wall charger.
